    <h2>How to Make Noodles?</h2>
    <p>
        This simple recipe for pasta with cottage cheese came from the Polish side of my family. We call it <strong>"cottage cheese and noodles"</strong> or <strong>"lazy man pierogies."</strong> It's a great comfort food and can be made with any kind of noodle. You can serve it as a side dish, but we always enjoy it as a main course.
