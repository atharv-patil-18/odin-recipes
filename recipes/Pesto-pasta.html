    <h2>How to Make Pesto Pasta?</h2>
    <p>
        This simple recipe for pasta with cottage cheese came from the Polish side of my family. We call it <strong>"cottage cheese and noodles"</strong> or <strong>"lazy man pierogies."</strong> It's a great comfort food and can be made with any kind of noodle. You can serve it as a side dish, but we always enjoy it as a main course.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta: Start with your favorite pasta shape. </li>
            <li>1 Onion and oil: Cook the onion in olive oil until it's translucent. </li>
            <li>1 Pesto: Use store-bought or homemade pesto sauce.</li>
            <li>1 Seasonings: This pesto pasta is simply seasoned with salt and pepper. </li>
            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
            <li>Cheese: Grate your own Parmesan cheese instead of using the pre-shredded stuff. </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer into a large bowl. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in pesto, salt, and pepper until warmed through. </li>
            <li>Add pesto mixture to hot pasta; stir in grated cheese and toss well to coat. .</li>
        </ol>
